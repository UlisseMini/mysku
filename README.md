An app for privacy-preserving location sharing with lots of friends, alumni groups, etc.


### things needed for app store

for beta review:
- rest of app store ready for submission stuff (but like, not high stakes)
- fix miniworld.app infinite redirects

this thing:
- round to lat/lon (or really world-grid): way better privacy than random vector


### notes to not forget

let's get this working at some point so we can get list of friends and share that way too.

```
relationships.read
allows your app to know a user's friends and implicit relationships - requires Discord approval
```
