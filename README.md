An app for privacy-preserving location sharing with lots of friends, alumni groups, etc.


Concrete plan/todos:

- [ ] Apply to app store (goal: in the next ~2 days?)
    - [ ] Smooth discord oauth login process
    - [ ] Working map with discord icons from mutual servers
        - [ ] (And settings page where you select which servers to share location with.)
        - [ ] Requires basic backend. NOTE: do not store privacy settings on backend(?) or maybe do b.c it tells us what circles to draw around ppl if we're doing that.
    - [ ] Basic adjustable privacy controls (adjust privacy radius, block ppl, disable updates temporarily, etc.)
    - [ ] Apply: Speedrun finding decent icon, going through everything etc. Fresh application. Ask only for foreground location perms to start.
