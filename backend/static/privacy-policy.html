    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated: March 2024</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>MySku is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and store only the minimum information necessary to provide
        location sharing functionality between Discord users who mutually opt-in.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not directed to children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant
        jurisdiction.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your
        child
        has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord Account Information:</strong> Basic Discord profile data including user ID, username, and
            avatar.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your approximate location, only when you choose to share it.</li>
        <li><strong>Guild Information:</strong> Basic information about Discord servers (guilds) you're in to enable
            sharing with specific communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information required for app functionality, such as
            operating system version and device type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Discord information is collected when you log in using Discord's official authentication</li>
        <li>Location data is only collected when you explicitly enable location sharing</li>
        <li>Device information is collected automatically when you use the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Location Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is our priority when it comes to location sharing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location sharing is completely optional and off by default</li>
        <li>Your precise location is never sent to our servers - it is anonymized on your device first</li>
        <li>By default, locations are anonymized to within approximately 2km radius</li>
        <li>You control exactly which Discord servers can see your location</li>
        <li>You can block specific users from seeing your location</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To show your approximate location to users you've chosen to share with</li>
        <li>To display which Discord servers you can share your location with</li>
        <li>To enforce your privacy preferences about who can see your location</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>We store only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Discord user information</li>
        <li>Your privacy settings (enabled guilds and blocked users)</li>
        <li>Your last shared location (if you've chosen to share it)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored only as long as you maintain an active account. You can delete your data using the "Delete
        Account" option in the app settings.</p>
    <p>When you request data deletion, we will remove all your personal information from our systems immediately. This
        includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Discord profile information</li>
        <li>Your location data</li>
        <li>Your location sharing preferences</li>
        <li>Any other data associated with your account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy
        on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your information is only shared with other users based on your explicit privacy settings. We never sell or share
        your data with third parties.</p>
