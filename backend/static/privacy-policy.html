    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: February 19, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>MySku is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and store only the minimum information necessary to
        provide
        location sharing functionality between Discord users who mutually opt-in.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not directed to children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant
        jurisdiction.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe
        your
        child
        has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord Account Information:</strong> Basic Discord profile data including user ID, username,
            and
            avatar.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your approximate location, only when you choose to share it. This is
            collected through your device's location services when you explicitly enable location sharing.</li>
        <li><strong>Guild Information:</strong> Basic information about Discord servers (guilds) you're in to enable
            sharing with specific communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information required for app functionality, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Operating system version</li>
                <li>Device type</li>
                <li>App version</li>
                <li>Device identifiers (for functionality purposes only)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Discord information is collected when you log in using Discord's official authentication</li>
        <li>Location data is only collected when you explicitly enable location sharing</li>
        <li>Device information is collected automatically when you use the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Location Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is our priority when it comes to location sharing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location sharing is completely optional and off by default</li>
        <li>Your precise location is never sent to our servers - it is anonymized on your device first</li>
        <li>By default, locations are anonymized to within approximately 2km radius</li>
        <li>You control exactly which Discord servers can see your location</li>
        <li>You can block specific users from seeing your location</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To show your approximate location to users you've chosen to share with</li>
        <li>To display which Discord servers you can share your location with</li>
        <li>To enforce your privacy preferences about who can see your location</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We store only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Discord user information</li>
        <li>Your privacy settings (enabled guilds and blocked users)</li>
        <li>Your last shared location (if you've chosen to share it)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption and security practices. Your location data is
        anonymized before being stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored only as long as you maintain an active account. You can delete your data at any time
        through
        the following methods:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Contacting us through Discord to request data deletion</li>
        <li>Revoking Discord authentication access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you request data deletion, we will remove all your personal information from our systems within 30 days.
        This
        includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Discord profile information</li>
        <li>Your location data</li>
        <li>Your location sharing preferences</li>
        <li>Any other data associated with your account</li>

        permanently
        deleted.</p>
